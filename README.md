--------

working on a supplied data from a camera fixed above a conveyor belt and a collected data using a mobile camera, using the supplied data with Nvidia DIGITS workflow to train a model by tuning the hyperparameters and choosing the best network to achieve a specific inference time and accuracy, using the collected data for an inference idea and training a model using Nvidia DIGITS to deploy this model on an embedded  system like Jetson TX2 board.
