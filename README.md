abstract
--------

working on a supplied data from a camera fixed above a conveyor belt and a collected data using a mobile camera, using the supplied data with Nvidia DIGITS workflow to train a model by tuning the hyperparameters and choosing the best network to achieve a specific inference time and accuracy, using the collected data for an inference idea and training a model using Nvidia DIGITS to deploy this model on an embedded  system like Jetson TX2 board.


Introduction
------------

the robotic kitchen is now an interesting part of robotics which full of challenges, due to the routine of life nowadays we are very busy because of the tight schedules, so it's difficult to take care of our food, people tend to approach fast-food instead of preparing healthy meals at home which leads to severe diseases.

nowadays there are some cooking robots which enable us to cook the food.

they are fully automated robots, so they have to capture the world around them using several kinds of sensors and cameras.
in turn classifying images around the robot and determining each kitchenware is a core element of the robot perception process, using Nvidia DIGITS workflow with a collected photos of spoons or forks or even no thing to train a network for the classification processes.
